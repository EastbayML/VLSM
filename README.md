# VSLM
Very Small Language Models.  Inspired by Andrej Karpathy


## Goal
This is a project by the West Coast Machine Learning group. 
We hope to create a small language model that can be trained in  a few hours.  We would like to experiment with various novel ideas as well as recreate experiments that others have create.

## Experiment brainstorming
Intially this will be a google doc to make it easy for folks to edit. We will eventually move the list into this repository.  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zCrQ8nPTi2SWVoJ5N2FFLrme8E9I49I_nl9hFt1SykY/edit?usp=sharing

## The Plan

* Clone the nanoGPT repository and get the baseline running. 
* We will use TinyStories to start with as our datas. Create a prepare.py for TinyStories to download the dataset
* Find a model size that can be reasonably trained in a couple hours
* Develop a method to test agains some standard benchmark
